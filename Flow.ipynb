Recalculate the monthly carbon footprint based on the recommendations adopted and their associated reduction amount which was provided in your previous analysis.\\n2. Analyze the implementation completeness if partial steps were taken\\n3. Calculate the percentage improvement from the initial footprint\\n\\nPlease perform the following analysis in <carbon_analysis> tags:\\n\\n1. Recalculate monthly carbon footprint:\\n   - Write down the initial monthly carbon footprint from the user\\'s profile\\n   - Note the reduction amount from the completed recommendation\\n   - Calculate and write out the new total monthly carbon footprint in kg (initial - reduction)\\n   - Determine the reduction achieved\\n\\n2. Analyze implementation completeness ( if and only if partial steps were taken):\\n   - List out each step mentioned in the specific_steps_taken\\n   - Compare these steps to the specific_recommendation\\n   - Estimate completeness as a percentage based on steps completed\\n   - Calculate remaining potential for carbon reduction (reduction_amount * (1 - completeness))\\n\\n3. Calculate percentage improvement:\\n   - Write out the calculation: (reduction_achieved / initial_footprint) * 100\\n   - Calculate the percentage improvement\\n\\n4. Prepare additional steps (if applicable):\\n   - If implementation was partial, list additional steps the user can take based on the specific_recommendation\\n\\nBased on your analysis, provide the output in the following JSON format:\\n\\n{\\n  \"updated_footprint\": {\\n    \"total_monthly_kg\": number,\\n    \"reduction_achieved\": number,\\n    \"percent_improvement\": number\\n  },\\n  \"implementation_analysis\": {\\n    \"completeness\": number,\\n    \"remaining_potential\": number,\\n    \"additional_steps\": string[]\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nEnsure all numbers are rounded to two decimal places. \\nThe \"completeness\" and \"remaining_potential\" should be expressed as percentages (e.g., 75 for 75%). \\nThe \"additional_steps\" array should be empty if implementation was complete. \\nYou must stick to the provided format and only provide what is asked for in the JSON output.'}]"
